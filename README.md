# Getting Started with Coding Challenge - Frontend Developer - Kenneth Sia

- Limitations and Obstruction

  - I decided to use a UI LIbrary (Material UI) in this exercise to save time and focus on the implementation given that the exercise is time constrained
  - Access-Control-Allow-Origin "\*" was not set on the provided resource https://7ys8lfh4mc.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/beta/coding-challenge/configuration thus the loading from file
  - Actual form submission (posting to an external resource or API) is not included in the implementation, but the "element" state is available and printed in the bottom of the app page for reference of current state of the form and its values.
  - Typescript was not used because as i'm still in the process of learning and adapting it in my workflow and skills. opted for javascript for now.

- Libraries used
  - React JS
  - Material UI
  - Testing Library (Jest)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
